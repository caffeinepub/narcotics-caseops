# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the ANTF Structure reference page content to match the provided “Anti-Narcotics Task Force (Ops)” organizational structure narrative and professional English copy.

**Planned changes:**
- Update `/antf-structure` page text to reflect the correct command hierarchy (Special Inspector General of Police; HQ Pune; Deputy Inspector General of Police at HQ; SP (Ops) Pune Unit; SP (Ops) Nagpur Unit), subordinate postings under Pune and Nagpur territory units, and the range-district mapping list for Dy.SP (Ops) divisions.
- Add the Legal Advisor section with the provided description and the three responsibilities listed in the given order.
- Add the Forensic Expert section with the provided description, including the note that posts may be increased in the future depending on scope of work.
- Add the staffing composition statement for each Dy.SP (Ops) Division (total 31 personnel with the specified role breakdown).
- Correct obvious spelling/terminology issues in Appendix “A” and related page copy (e.g., Konkan spelling, Commissionerate spelling, place-name consistency) without changing meaning.

**User-visible outcome:** Visiting `/antf-structure` shows the updated ANTF (Ops) structure, role descriptions, staffing composition, and professionally spelled Appendix “A” district/jurisdiction text in English.
