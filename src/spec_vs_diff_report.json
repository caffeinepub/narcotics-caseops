  "summary": "The diff updates the ANTF Structure page with an English hierarchy narrative (SIGP head, HQ Pune, DIG at HQ, SP (Ops) Pune/Nagpur units) and adds a range-division list plus an Appendix “A” section shell. However, the diff does not show the required Legal Advisor/Forensic Expert sections, the Dy.SP staffing composition statement, nor sufficient evidence of the requested spelling/terminology cleanups across Appendix “A”. It also includes changes to project metadata files that were not requested.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Include the Legal Advisor and Forensic Expert role descriptions exactly as provided (Legal Advisor responsibilities list in order; Forensic Expert description and future-scope note).",
      "reason": "In the shown AntfStructurePage content, only the hierarchy and the beginning of Appendix “A” are present; there is no clearly labeled Legal Advisor section, no responsibilities list, and no Forensic Expert section/description visible in the diff summary.",

      "reason": "The diff shows an Appendix “A” heading and the start of a district list, but the district items are truncated and there is no explicit evidence of correcting the cited typos (e.g., Commissionerate/Commissionrate variants) across the Appendix lists.",
